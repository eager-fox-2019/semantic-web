        <p class="w3-justify">Tron: Legacy is a 2010 American science fiction action film directed by Joseph Kosinski
            from a screenplay written by Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis, based on a story by Horowitz, Kitsis, Brian
            Klugman and Lee Sternthal. It is a sequel to the 1982 film Tron, whose director Steven Lisberger returned to
            produce. The cast includes Jeff Bridges and Bruce Boxleitner reprising their roles as Kevin Flynn and Alan
            Bradley, respectively, as well as Garrett Hedlund, Olivia Wilde, James Frain, Beau Garrett and Michael
            Sheen. The story follows Flynn's adult son Sam, who responds to a message from his long-lost father and is
            transported into a virtual reality called "The Grid," where Sam, his father, and the algorithm Quorra must
            stop the malevolent program Clu from invading the real world.

            Interest in creating a sequel to Tron arose after the film garnered a cult following. After much
            speculation, Walt Disney Pictures began a concerted effort in 2005 to devise Tron: Legacy, with the hiring
            of Klugman and Sternthal as writers. Kosinski was recruited as director two years later. As he was not
            optimistic about Disney's Matrix-esque approach to the film, Kosinski filmed a high-concept, which he used
            to conceptualise the universe of Legacy and convince the studio to greenlight the film. Principal
            photography took place in Vancouver over 67 days, in and around the city's central business district. Most
            sequences were shot in 3D and ten companies were involved with the extensive visual effects work. Chroma
            keying and other techniques were used to allow more freedom in creating effects. Daft Punk composed the
            musical score, incorporating orchestral sounds with their trademark electronic music.

            Tron: Legacy premiered in Tokyo on November 30, 2010 and was theatrically released in North America on
            December 17, 2010. Disney vigorously promoted the film across multiple media platforms, including
            merchandising, consumer products, theme parks and advertising. Upon its release, the film received mixed
            reviews from film critics, who praised the visual effects, production design and soundtrack, but criticized
            the character development, cast performance and story. The film grossed $400 million during its worldwide
            theatrical run, making it a box office success. The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Sound
            Editing at the 83rd Academy Awards, but lost to Inception.</p>

                Originally known as Tron, Rinzler's identity came into being when Tron was "repurposed" by Clu.

                In TRON: Uprising, Tron was forced to adopt the name and appearance of Rinzler after his battle with
                Clu, using the disguise to avoid capture as most programs believed that he was dead.</p>
